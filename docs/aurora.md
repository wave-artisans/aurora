# Aurora - The Seven Modes of a Modern Human

> *A system for people who build, play, surf, and create — powered by tech, rhythm, and intention.*

---

## 🌅 **The Idea**

> You live in motion — between ocean waves, deep work, gigs, clients, and experiments.

> “Aurora” isn’t a to-do list; it’s your **color language for energy and intent**.

> Every color = a *mode of being*.

> Every mode = a different flavor of focus.

> It’s your way to tell your tools — Finder, Calendar, Reminders, ChatGPT, and Shortcuts —

> “Hey, this is what I’m doing *right now*. Tune everything to that.”

## ⚡️ **The Seven Modes**

| **Color**          | **Mode**                                                                          | **Vibe**                                               | **Where It Flows** |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 🔴 **Commitments** | The pulse. The gigs, launches, deadlines, and promises you actually have to keep. | Calls, travel, sessions, client deadlines, drop days.  |                    |
| 🟢 **Focus**       | The zone. Headphones on, code running, edits flowing, guitar humming.             | Writing, coding, composing, photo editing.             |                    |
| 🟡 **Ops**         | The backbone. The not-sexy but necessary — money, systems, setup.                 | Invoices, taxes, emails, admin, maintenance.           |                    |
| 🟠 **Collab**      | The vibe-share. Co-creating, jamming, syncing with your people.                   | Reviews, rehearsals, brainstorms, partnerships.        |                    |
| 🔵 **Life**        | The ride. Surf, play, rest, love, breathe.                                        | Surf sessions, dinners, music, meditation.             |                    |
| 🟣 **Explore**     | The horizon. Curiosity without agenda.                                            | Reading, tinkering, R&D, trying new tech or riffs.     |                    |
| ⚫️ **Archive**     | The echo. The stuff that’s done but deserves a home.                              | Final masters, shipped code, past shoots, legacy work. |                    |

## 🧭 **How It Works**

1. **Tag everything by color.**

Files, notes, events, tasks — all get one tag that matches the *mode you’re in*.

	- A photoshoot you’re planning → 🔴
	- Editing those photos → 🟢
	- Sending invoices → 🟡
	- Reviewing with a collaborator → 🟠
	- Weekend surf trip → 🔵
	- Learning a new lens → 🟣
	- Finished album → ⚫️
1. **Change color as life moves.**

A project can shift from 🟣 to 🟢 to 🔴 to ⚫️. That’s the point — Aurora is fluid.

1. **One color per thing.**

Simple rule: pick the main energy, don’t overthink it. Aurora is meant to *feel right*, not be perfect.

1. **Colors talk to your tech.**

Each mode can trigger your automations, tools, and agents.

	- 🟢 opens Xcode, Logic Pro, and sets “Focus Mode.”
	- 🔵 plays your “Reset” playlist, opens Health, and mutes Slack.
	- 🟣 launches Safari with your reading list and Knowledge vault.

## 🎛️ **Your Digital Surfboard: App Setup**

### **Finder**

Your file system becomes a visual map of your energy.

| **Folder** | **Tag** | **Example**                      |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `/Clients` | 🔴      | Projects with deadlines.         |
| `/Studio`  | 🟢      | Deep creative or coding work.    |

| `/Crew`    | 🟠      | Shared docs and team folders.    |
| `/Life`    | 🔵      | Photos, playlists, travel notes. |
| `/R&D`     | 🟣      | Experiments and ideas.           |
| `/Archive` | ⚫️      | Old stuff worth keeping.         |

---

### **Reminders**

Turn your task lists into flow playlists:

- **Waves Pumping (🔴)** → due today, tag:🔴
- **Deep Field (🟢)** → tag:🟢
- **Quick Ops (🟡)** → tag:🟡 and #quick
- **Jam & Sync (🟠)** → tag:🟠
- **Recharge (🔵)** → tag:🔵
- **Curiosity Queue (🟣)** → tag:🟣
- **Done & Dusted (⚫️)** → tag:⚫️

---

### **Calendar**

Your week should *look like a wave form* — balanced color rhythm.

- **Red = obligations.**
- **Green = flow time.**
- **Orange = collaboration bursts.**
- **Yellow = system days.**
- **Blue = recovery + fun.**
- **Purple = curiosity.**
- **Gray = past seasons.**

When your calendar looks like a healthy light show, you’re good.

### **ChatGPT Projects**

Label projects by their core mode:

- 🟢 *“New Album Engine”* → deep creative focus.
- 🟠 *“Client Portal Build”* → collab sprint.
- 🟣 *“AI Photography Sandbox”* → exploration.
- 🟡 *“BizOps Agent”* → operational backbone.
- 🔵 *“Life Dashboard”* → personal systems.

Your AI agents can read these tags to switch tone, tempo, and context automatically.

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| 🟢 **Focus Mode**       | Kills distractions, launches your creative suite, sets “Studio Lights,” plays Pink Floyd or Tycho. |
| 🟡 **Ops Mode**         | Opens Notion finance dashboard, loads accounting scripts, logs time.                               |
| 🟠 **Collab Mode**      | Opens Mail, Notes, Messages, and Notion “Team Hub,” starts your “Meeting Stream” agent.            |
| 🔵 **Life Mode**        | Plays “Ocean Air” playlist, shows weather + tide, opens Apple Music + Health.                      |
| 🟣 **Explore Mode**     | Opens your reading list, saves new tabs to “Curiosity,” fires up AI Research Agent.                |
| ⚫️ **Archive Mode**     | Moves completed files to Archive, exports summary to Notion, backups everything.                   |

## 🌊 **The Aurora Principles**

1. **Color = Energy, not Status.**

Red isn’t urgent — it’s *committed*. Green isn’t “active” — it’s *focused*.

1. **Change color often.**

You don’t fail when you switch; you *surf the wave*.

1. **Every week has a pattern.**

Look at your week in color. Too much red or yellow = burnout ahead.

Add green (create) and blue (live).

1. **Your system breathes.**

When you feel off — don’t add tasks. Change colors.

Switch to 🟣 for curiosity or 🔵 for balance.

1. **Live analog, sync digital.**

Aurora exists so you can step away from screens *without chaos*.

It’s your visual rhythm map.

## 🔮 **Aurora Philosophy**

> You’re not chasing productivity.

> You’re designing resonance — between your tools, your time, and your energy.

You surf the physical ocean 🌊 and the digital one 🌐.

Aurora is your tide chart — guiding when to paddle hard, when to ride, and when to float.

Each color is a current.

Your job?

Ride it with style.
